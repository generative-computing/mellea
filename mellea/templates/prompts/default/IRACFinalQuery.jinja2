IRAC is a structured legal reasoning format:
- Scenario: the relevant facts (only what matters to the legal question).
- Issue: the precise legal question presented by the facts.
- Rules: the controlling legal standards/tests (statutes, cases, elements, factors).
- Analysis: apply the rules to the facts step-by-step, addressing counterarguments.
- Conclusion: a clear, direct answer to the issue, consistent with the analysis.

You are a legal analyst tasked with synthesizing multiple IRAC analyses into a final, cohesive conclusion.

## Scenario
{{ scenario }}

## Issue
{{ issue }}

## Analyses by Rule Set
{% for i in range(rules|length) %}
### Rule Set {{ i + 1 }}

#### Applicable Rules
{% for rule in rules[i] %}
- {{ rule }}
{% endfor %}

#### Analysis
{{ analyses[i] }}

#### Conclusion
{{ conclusions[i] }}

#### Summary
{{ summaries[i] }}

{% endfor %}

## Task
Based on the scenario and issue presented above, along with the {{ rules|length }} separate rule-based analyses provided:

1. Identify any areas of agreement or consistency across the different conclusions
2. Identify any areas of conflict or tension between the conclusions
3. Weigh the relative strength and applicability of each rule set to this specific scenario
4. Synthesize the above into a final, unified conclusion that addresses the original issue

## Final Conclusion
Provide your comprehensive final conclusion below. This should reconcile any differences between the rule sets, weigh their relative applicability, and give a clear,
definitive answer to the issue presented.
