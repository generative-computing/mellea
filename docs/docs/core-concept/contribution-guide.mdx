### Contributor Guide: Requirements and Verifiers

Contributing new Requirements (i.e., verifiers) is an easy way to get started contributing to Mellea. Requirements can be as general or as domain-specific as you'd like, but must encapsulate a coherent and testable property. We have seen many examples of Requirements throughout this tutorial.

If you write a Requirement that is general-purose and likely useful to others, consider contributing your _general-purpose_ component to Mellea's standard library:

1. Find a file in `mellea/stdlib/reqlib/` where your requirement belongs; if no file fits, create a new one.
2. Implement your requirement. Ideally, your verifier should be robust, which typically means not using the default LLMaJ behavior. If the requirement can be checked with code, you should write a validation function. See [our Markdown requirements](/core-concept/requirements) for some examples of how this works. You could also [tune (and evaluate) a well-calibrated aLoRA](/core-concept/tuning) for requirements that are not possible to implement in code.
3. Open a PR. If your Requirement uses LLMaJ, be sure to include a robust evaluation suite in your PR demonstrating that LLMaJ verification is good enough.

One important note: if your requirement can be easily specified in terms of a grammatical constraint, then you should consider using constrained generation (by passing `format=` into your session or generate call -- see [agent implementation](/core-concept/agents) for some examples) instead of using requirements.

### Contributor Guide: Components

Components are the building blocks of Mellea. The point of a Component is that it has a way to represent itself to a Backend, its `format_for_llm` function. When creating a new component, you will most likely want to have `format_for_llm` return a `TemplateRepresentation`, a structured representation of itself that includes template args, tools, and the template itself.

Components are best created when you find yourself with data/objects that you are frequently formatting and marshalling into text to interact with LLMs.

To create a new component, you must both define it in code and (in most cases) create a template for it. Components are also runtime checkable protocols, so you need not inherit from the base class; you can simply add the required methods to an existing class as well.

When distributing a new Component, think of the Component the same way you think about a software library. Components are self-contained, well-documented, amenable to reuse, and hopefully also composable with other Components.

You have a couple of options for distributing your Component. You can distribute the Component as a library in user-space, or you can request that the Component is incorporated into the Mellea stdlib. Most Components are best positioned as third party libraries. You can distribute third-party generative programming components just like you distribute any third party library (github, pypi).

For Components that implement useful and widely used patterns, inclusion in the the Mellea stdlib may make sense. These are the early days of generative programming; we expect that some contributions will have pride-of-place in the Mellea standard library. We encourage contributors to ask early and often about inclusion in the stdlib.

### Contributor Guide: Specialized Mify

Mifying an object is another way to make it compatible with `Mellea`. Just like with Components, there is a `MifiedProtocol` that is a runtime checkable protocol. `@mify` or `mify(object)` adds the required methods to any object.

Since it's a protocol, you can create your own `mify` functions that wrap a class/object or add the required functionality to that class/object in any way you want.

For instance, you may have an ORM library where most of your objects follow the same pattern and structure. To integrate that library with `Mellea`, one approach would be to write a specific `mify` function that knows about that structure. It could look something like this:

```python
T = TypeVar("T")
def mify_orm(obj: T):
  setattr(obj, "format_for_llm", obj.sql)
  ...
```

In this way, you can define a common way to `mify` all components of this library on the fly, assuming they all have a `sql` function.

For a specialized mify function to be added to the stdlib, it must work as both a decorator and a function that can be called directly on objects/classes. It must also be a generic but useful pattern or a pattern for a widely used library.

### Contributor Guide: Sessions

While a less common need, Mellea allows you to create new types of sessions. When you need fine-grained control over context, it's advised that you completely override the `MelleaSession` methods.

To institute gates on calls that get made or modify calls without modifying the underlying context, overriding the methods but calling the `MelleaSession` supermethod is advised.
