One of the main principles of generative programming is that you should prompt models in the same way that the models were aligned. But sometimes off-the-shelf models are insufficient. Here are some scenarios we have encountered:

- you are introducing a custom Component with non-trivial semantics that are not well-covered by any existing model's training data
- off-shelf-models fail to recognize important business constraints
- you have a proprietary labeled dataset which you would like to use for improving classification, intent detection, or another requirement-like task.

The third case is very common. In this tutorial we will explore a case-study focused on that case. we walk through fine-tuning a LoRA adapter using classification data to enhance a requirement checker. We then explain how this fine-tuned adapter can be incorporated into a Mellea program.

### Problem Statement

The Stembolt MFG Corporation we encountered in [Generative Slots](/core-concept/generative-slots) is now is developing an AI agent to improve its operational efficiency and resilience. A key component of this pipeline is the AutoTriage module. AutoTriage is responsible for automatically mapping free-form defect reports into categories like mini-carburetor, piston, connecting rod, flywheel, piston rings, no_failure.

To ensure the generated output meets specific downstream system requirements, we require that each defect summary contains an identified failure mode. Unfortunately, LLMs perform poorly on this task out-of-the-box; stembolts are a niche device and detect reports are not commonly discussed on the open internet. Fortunately, over the years, Stembolt MFG has collected a large dataset mapping notes to part failures, and this is where the classifier trained via aLoRA comes in.

Here's peak at a small subset of Stembolt MFG's carefully [dataset of stembolt failure modes](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea/blob/main/docs/examples/aLora/stembolt_failure_dataset.jsonl):

<CodeGroup>

```json JSON
{"item": "Observed black soot on intake. Seal seems compromised under thermal load.", "label": "piston rings"}
{"item": "Rotor misalignment caused torsion on connecting rod. High vibration at 3100 RPM.", "label": "connecting rod"}
{"item": "Combustion misfire traced to a cracked mini-carburetor flange.", "label": "mini-carburetor"}
{"item": "stembolt makes a whistling sound and does not complete the sealing process", "label": "no_failure"}
```

</CodeGroup>

Notice that the last item is labeled "no_failure", because the root cause of that issue is user error. Stembolts are difficult to use and require specialized training; approximately 20% of reported failures are actually operator error. Classifying operator error as early in the process as possible -- and with sufficient accuracy -- is an important KPI for the customer service and repairs department of the Stembolt division.

Let's see how Stembolt MFG Corporation can use tuned LoRAs to implement the AutoTriage step in a larger Mellea application.

### Training the aLoRA Adapter

Mellea provides a command-line interface for training [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) or [aLoRA](https://github.com/IBM/activated-lora) adapters. Classical LoRAs must re-process our entire context, which can get expensive for quick checks happening within an inner loop (such as requirement checking). The aLoRA method allows us to adapt a base LLM to new tasks, and then run the adapter with minimal compute overhead. The adapters are fast to train and fast to switch between.

We will train a lightweight adapter with the `m alora train` command on this small dataset:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Bash
m alora train /to/stembolts_data.jsonl \
  --promtfile ./prompt_config.json \
  --basemodel ibm-granite/granite-3.2-8b-instruct \
  --outfile ./checkpoints/alora_adapter \
  --adapter alora \
  --epochs 6 \
  --learning-rate 6e-6 \
  --batch-size 2 \
  --max-length 1024 \
  --grad-accum 4
```

</CodeGroup>
The default prompt format is `<|start_of_role|>check_requirement<|end_of_role|>`; this prompt should be appended to the context just before activated our newly trained aLoRA. If needed, you can customize this prompt using the `--promptfile` argument.

#### Parameters

While training adapters, you can easily tuning the hyper-parameters as below:

| Flag              | Type    | Default    | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `--basemodel`     | `str`   | _required_ | Hugging Face model ID or local path       |
| `--outfile`       | `str`   | _required_ | Directory to save the adapter weights     |
| `--adapter`       | `str`   | `"alora"`  | Choose between `alora` or standard `lora` |
| `--epochs`        | `int`   | `6`        | Number of training epochs                 |
| `--learning-rate` | `float` | `6e-6`     | Learning rate                             |
| `--batch-size`    | `int`   | `2`        | Per-device batch size                     |
| `--max-length`    | `int`   | `1024`     | Max tokenized input length                |
| `--grad-accum`    | `int`   | `4`        | Gradient accumulation steps               |
| `--promptfile`    | `str`   | None       | Directory to load the prompt format       |

### Upload to Hugging Face (Optional)

To share or reuse the trained adapter, use the `m alora upload` command to publish your trained adapter:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Bash
m alora upload ./checkpoints/alora_adapter \
  --name stembolts/failuremode-alora
```

</CodeGroup>
This will:

- Create the Hugging Face model repo (if it doesn't exist)
- Upload the contents of the `outfile` directory
- Requires a valid `HF_TOKEN` via `huggingface-cli login`

If you get a permissions error, make sure you are logged in to Huggingface:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Bash huggingface-cli login # Optional: only needed for uploads ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  **Warning on Privacy:** Before uploading your trained model to the Hugging
  Face Hub, review the visibility carefully. If you will be sharing your model
  with the public, consider whether your training data includes any proprietary,
  confidential, or sensitive information. Language models can unintentionally
  memorize details, and this problem compounds when operating over small or
  domain-specific datasets.
</Note>
### Integrating the Tuned Model into Mellea

After training an aLoRA classifier for our task, we would like to use that classifier to check requirements in a Mellea program. First, we need to setup our backend for using the aLoRA classifier:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
backend = ...

# assumption the `m` backend must be a Huggingface or alora-compatible vLLM backend, with the same base model from which we trained the alora.

# ollama does NOT yet support LoRA or aLoRA adapters.

backend.add_alora(
HFConstraintAlora(
name="stembolts_failuremode_alora",
path_or_model_id="stembolts/failuremode-alora", # can also be the checkpoint path
generation_prompt="<|start_of_role|>check_requirement<|end_of_role|>",
backend=m.backend,
)
)

````
</CodeGroup>
In the above arguments, `path_or_model_id` refers to the model checkpoint from last step, i.e., the `m alora train` process.

<Note>
The `generation_prompt` passed to your `backend.add_alora` call should exactly match the prompt used for training.
</Note>
We are now ready to create a M session, define the requirement, and run the instruction:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
m = MelleaSession(backend, ctx=ChatContext())
failure_check = req("The failure mode should not be none.")
res = m.instruct("Write triage summaries based on technician note.", requirements=[failure_check])
````

</CodeGroup>

To make the requirement work well with the well-trained alora model, we need also define the requirement validator function:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
def validate_reqs(reqs: list[Requirement]):
    """Validate the requirements against the last output in the session."""
    print("==== Validation =====")
    print(
        "using aLora"
        if backend.default_to_constraint_checking_alora
        else "using NO alora"
    )

    # helper to collect validation prompts (because validation calls never get added to session contexts).
    logs: list[GenerateLog] = []  # type: ignore

    # Run the validation. No output needed, because the last output in "m" will be used. Timing added.
    start_time = time.time()
    val_res = m.validate(reqs, generate_logs=logs)
    end_time = time.time()
    delta_t = end_time - start_time

    print(f"Validation took {delta_t} seconds.")
    print("Validation Results:")

    # Print list of requirements and validation results
    for i, r in enumerate(reqs):
        print(f"- [{val_res[i]}]: {r.description}")

    # Print prompts using the logs list
    print("Prompts:")
    for log in logs:
        if isinstance(log, GenerateLog):
            print(f" - {{prompt: {log.prompt}\n   raw result: {log.result.value} }}")  # type: ignore

    return end_time - start_time, val_res
```

</CodeGroup>
Then we can use this validator function to check the generated defect report as:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
validate_reqs([failure_check])
```

</CodeGroup>

If the constraint alora is added to a model, it will be used by default. You can also force to run without alora as:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
backend.default_to_constraint_checking_alora = False
```

</CodeGroup>
In this chapter, we have seen how a classification dataset can be used to tune a
LoRA adapter on proprietary data. We then saw how the resulting model can be incorporated into a Mellea generative program. This is the tip of a very big iceberg.
