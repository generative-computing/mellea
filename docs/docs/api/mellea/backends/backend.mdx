`FormatterBackend`s support legacy model types.

The `mellea` library was designed to support generative computing with [spanned attention](https://generative.computing/what-are-spans.html) over [generative programming primitives](https://generative.computing/what-are-generative-programs.html).
In the ideal world, context management is handled via span scope-relations and all generative programming primitives are baked into the model via fine-tuning.
I.e., the model's instruction tuning is done in terms of generative programming primitives, and the model is then prompted with the same set of templates that were used for that tuning.

Today, most models do not yet support spans and even those that do are not properly tuned to leverage generative programming primitives.
The `mellea` library supports these legacy models primarily through prompt engineering surfaced via `FormatterBackends`.
A `FormatterBackend` is a backend that uses hand-engineered prompts for rendering generative programming primitives to a model and parsing responses from the model back into `mellea`.
By default, a `FormatterBackend` uses jinja2 templates for pretty-printing, and relies on the user's ad-hoc logic for parsing.
