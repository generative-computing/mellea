"""Example of chain-of-thought reasoning on a mathematical question from the GSM8K dataset, structured as code for improved performance with the granite-3.3-8B model. The original accuracy in standard "thinking" mode is approximately 80%, while this implementation achieves 85-89% accuracyâ€”up to 9 points higher.

This demonstrates that generative decorators are sufficient for complex reasoning tasks: not only do they maintain or improve performance, but they also significantly enhance observability and control. For instance, the structured Thought titles can be easily surfaced in a UI, providing instant insight into the model's reasoning process.

    """Generates a comprehensive, explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) solution for the input question,
    with a rigorous focus on correct, cumulative state tracking and operation logic at every step.

    This function decomposes the reasoning process into a sequential list of named, detailed steps,
    each surfacing all logic, calculations, and intermediate values, and explicitly maintaining the
    running state at every stage. The output is a ChainOfThought object containing a descriptive
    chain_name and an ordered list of Thought steps, each with:
      - step_name: A concise, descriptive label for the operation, inference, or transition at that step.
      - step_content: A fully explicit, self-contained explanation of the step's logic, calculation,
        starting and ending state, and the exact operation performed.

    **Principled Rules for Stepwise Reasoning (Best Practices):**
      - **Explicit Running State:**
        After every operation, clearly state:
          - The value(s) *before* the operation.
          - The operation itself (e.g., addition, subtraction).
          - The resulting value(s) *after* the operation.
        Never combine multiple operations into a single step or leave the running total implicit.
      - **Operation Transparency:**
        For every arithmetic or logical operation, write the equation in its canonical form (e.g.,
        "amount before purchase - cost of item = amount after purchase"), and solve for unknowns
        in context. This avoids conflating addition and subtraction, and ensures correct logic.
      - **No Gaps or Ambiguity:**
        Never omit intermediate calculations, even if they seem trivial. Avoid ambiguous references
        or pronouns. Always state exactly what is being operated on, and how the state changes.
      - **Self-Contained Logic:**
        Every step should be understandable in isolation, so the full solution can be reconstructed
        from the steps alone, without prior context.
      - **Descriptive Chain Name:**
        The chain_name should summarize the reasoning process or problem type.

    Args:
        question (str): The question requiring stepwise, explicit reasoning.

    Returns:
        ChainOfThought: An object with a descriptive chain_name and an ordered list of Thought steps,
        each surfacing all operations, values, and logic.
